Short term:
-----------
 - Check conversion factor moving between weights and phase space weights,
   around lines 300 and 309 in inclusive.py.
   Previously it was a hard-coded magic number of 1e9, which I (wjay) think is
   just 1e9 = (GeV/MeV)^3 = constants.GEV**3. This switch should be verified 
   independently by another set of eyes.
 - Implement FSI folding functions according to blackboard discussion
    - Breit-Wigner
    - Use final state momentum to correct matrix element
    - Obtain potential from scattering for folding function
 - Implement two body currents
 - Compare with electron scattering data

Long term:
----------

 - Refactor cascade code
    - Speed up angular variables calculation
    - Clean-up cascade code
 - Polish user defined input file/interface
 - Implement RES
 - Implement DIS
 - Implement neutrinos
 - Implement incoming beams
 - Other Event output file formats than LHE
 - Allow user to add custom libraries
