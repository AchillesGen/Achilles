Short term:
-----------

 - Finish reformatting
 - Implement FSI folding functions according to blackboard discussion
 - Refactor cascade code
 - Fix: formation zone
 - Understand Geant4 variable `center of mass momentum'
 - Figure out in VEGAS how to generate a fixed number of events
 - Implement user defined input file/interface
 - Implement two body currents
 - Event output file format (focus on LHE format)
    - NOTE (JI): LHE format has been implemented, do we want any others?
 - Compare with electron scattering data

Long term:
----------

 - Implement RES
 - Implement DIS
 - Implement neutrinos
 - Implement incoming beams
